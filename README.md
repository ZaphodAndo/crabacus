A code statistics visualiser for your projects.

## Notes
Types of data I might want to get:
- Files modified
- Files added
- Files deleted

- Lines modified
- Lines added
- Lines deleted

- Number of commits
- Number of PR's

Other ideas:
- Generate a report based on a time range
- Goes through all of your commits
- Graphs and data visulisation
